# JPG to PNG Converter

PNG's high-resolution images offer superior color depth and can deliver high-quality prints on home or industrial printers. Meanwhile, lossy compression could make JPG photos become blurry or lose color when they're printed. So that I would like to create a JPGtoPNG Converter here. 

So for this I will be using Pokedex folder with images in JPEG format. Then I am converting the images to PNG format and save to a new/ folder.
